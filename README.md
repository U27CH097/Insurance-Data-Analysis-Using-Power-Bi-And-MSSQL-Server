# Insurance-Data-Analysis

### In this Project I Summarize Insurance Data to extract useful Insights from data using different Charts, Slicers, Cards..etc . Further I Publish Report to Power BI Services.

### This data consists of total 10,000 rows and 13 columns(PolicyNumber, CustomerID, Gender, Age, PolicyType, PolicyStartDate, PolicyEndDate, PremiumAmount, CoverageAmount, ClaimNumber, ClaimDate, ClaimAmount,	ClaimStatus)

# Steps Followed:
1. First load Data to MSSOL database.
2. Connect MSSQL Server To Power BI and load data to Power BI.
3. Data Transformation(Change Datatypes, Remove Duplicates).
4. Add Conditional Columns(Active/Inactive, Age Group).
5. Add Slicers(PolicyNumber,ClaimNumber, CustomerID)
6. Add Cards(PremiumAmount,CoverageAmount, ClaimAmount) and a Multi Card.
7. Add Riboon Chart, Donut Chart, Line Chart, Bar Chart.
8. Add a Matrix.
9. Add a Table.
10. Publish Report To Power BI Services.
    
# Key Insights:

### 1. Older customers (Senior Adult & Elder) are responsible for ~85% of claim payouts, suggesting LIC’s premium pricing should factor in age-based risk.
### 2. Balanced gender distribution.
### 3. Only a small portion of total coverage (₹16.9M out of ₹600.3M ~2.8%) has been claimed — showing strong risk control and policyholder stability.
### 4. High rejection rate (43.54%) might indicate documentation issues, policy mismatch, or fraud prevention filters. Reducing this could improve customer satisfaction.
### 5. About 42% policies are inactive, possibly due to non-renewals or expirations.
### 6. Travel and Health policies contribute 61.97 % of total premium, indicating LIC’s revenue depends heavily on these segments.
### 7. Travel and Health policies have both high premiums and high claim payouts, suggesting strong demand and claim activity.
